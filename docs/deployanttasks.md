AuraProcessEAR Task
If there are certain configurations in the applications for e.g. Security role mappings, JNDI bindings then those configurations can 
be defined in Deploydata.xml. Deploydata.xml can be supplied for each or subset of EAR files, this file 
will contain the configurations of the EAR file. Generally this file must not differ between environments, but if
 there is a requirement to support changes between the environments then tokensations can be used. In case
 of multi ear; AuraProcessEAR using maming conventions to find the deploydata in the deploydata
 directory mentioned in the ANT task. Naming conventioned is EARFileName-deploydata.xml.
If there are any Application configuration that are not supported by deloydata.xml format then you
 can use auraconfiglite to apply the configuration post deployment.
